                        <p>Note: changing this toggle saves your preference in your browser's "localStorage."</p>
                        <p>Viewing this site from files stored locally on your device (as a "file:" URL) instead of loaded over the internet (via "HTTP:" or "HTTPS:") means your preference may or may not affect the other pages of the Avalon Adventures site. This is because different browsers handle "file:" URLs differently. For instance, Firefox limits your preference to just the page you're on now, while Edge seems to honour your preference on every page. Don't be surprised if the light and dark modes change as you navigate the local version of Avalon Adventures.</p>
                        <p>In a live/production environment where the site is being served over the internet, changing your preference on one page should reflect in the others.</p>

                    <p aria-label="Our Land Acknowledgment.">Avalon Adventures recognizes the land on which we gather as the ancestral homelands of the Beothuk [bee-oth-uck], whose culture has now been erased forever. We also recognize the island of Ktaqmkuk [uk-dah-hum-gook] (Newfoundland) as the unceded, traditional territory of the Beothuk and the Mi'kmaq [mee-gum-maq]. We recognize all First Peoples who were here before us, those who live with us now, and the seven generations to come. As First Peoples have done since time immemorial, we strive to be responsible stewards of the land and to respect the cultures, ceremonies, and traditions of all who call it home. As we open our hearts and minds to the past, we commit ourselves to working in a spirit of truth and reconciliation to make a better future for all.</p>
