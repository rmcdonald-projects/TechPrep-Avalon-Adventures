"Avalon Adventures" is a fictional company invented by the Murphy Centre TechPrep program (https://murphycentre.ca/career-services/techprep/) as a basis for student web development projects. The Avalon Adventures logo and the bulk of the descriptive text are the creation and property of Murphy Centre.

My expression of the project contains images and video excerpts independently acquired from the internet, the use of which has not been specifically authorized by the copyright owners.

As I don't own the media or the bulk of the descriptive text, I cannot offer a license, and I ask that none of the media/text be shared/disseminated or used for licensed purposes.
